# My-Game
# 🎮 Orb Runner
**By Varun Pasunoori**

A small arcade-style web game built **specifically for this web developer application** using only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** — no external libraries or frameworks.

You control a glowing orb, collect energy orbs to score points, avoid hazards, and survive as long as you can as the difficulty increases.

## 🧩 Game Design Overview

**User Interaction:**  
Players move the orb using keyboard controls (`WASD` or arrow keys).  
They can pause (`P`) or restart after losing.  
The game also supports mouse-click buttons for start and retry.

**Rules:**  
- Collect yellow **orbs** to increase your score.  
- Avoid red **hazards** — each hit costs one life.  
- Grab blue **power-ups** to slow down time temporarily.  
- Lose all lives → Game Over.

**Challenge:**  
- Hazards spawn faster each level.  
- Player momentum adds a skill curve.  
- Power-ups appear rarely, creating risk/reward tension.

**Win/Lose Conditions:**  
- **Win:** Survive and achieve a high score.  
- **Lose:** When lives reach 0.  
- The current score, level, and lives display on-screen.

**Engagement:**  
- Increasing difficulty keeps players challenged.  
- Smooth motion, glowing effects, and subtle feedback keep gameplay dynamic.  
- Could easily expand with new power-ups, arena colors, or a high-score save system.
